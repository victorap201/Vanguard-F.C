EDA involved exploring the sales data to answer key question, such as:

3.	What is the average attendance for each category?
4.	Who are the 10 players with the most minutes?
5.	Who are the 3 fastest players by category?
6.	Relationship between weight and horizontal jump.
7.	What is the average of squat test by category?
8.	Does height influence the speed of athletes?
9.	Relationship between levels of strength (push-up) and minutes of matches in the U18 category?

### Results/Findings

-	U14 category had the best results during the tournament.

-	There is not significant difference between the number associated and guest.

-	The average attendance range is 84 and 85% between categories, which is an acceptable average established at the beginning of the season.

-	We have players with more than a thousand minutes, an aspect to consider when monitoring players.

-	 Weight has a great influence on the horizontal jump, however there are other factor that determine the results, such strength and technique.

-	As expected the U18 category has the best values in the squat test.

-	The result shows that height does not influence, meaning that the others elements such as strength and running technique are more important.

-	There is not significant relationship between the results of the Push-up test and Total minutes.
